<div align="center">
  <h1>RETRO BASIC HTML LAYOUT</h1><br>
  <p>A completely free to use HTML layout written only in HTML/CSS/JS. It's made to mimic retro geocities web design, and was actually one of the first design iterations used on my website! The template is made and encouraged to be used on webhosts such as Neocities, Nekoweb, Ichi City, and whatever other creative webhosts are prowling around these days! The template includes notes for new coders who may be confused about HTML, including what certain things do and where to put things like images etc. Use it, re-use it, and abuse it for all I care.</p>
